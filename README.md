# Code Challenge Chapter 3

This repository was created to complete the task of Chapter 3 code challenge from Binar Academy.
All this code is type by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridhanf).
 

Fell free to clone and code it by your self to learn more about HTML and CSS.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ridhanf/FSW5_RFadhil_03_Challenge.git
```
